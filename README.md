# EncryptionChallenge
Hey I've made a CTF Encryption challenge. All you need to do is get the flag from the encrypted file.  
the encrypted file is located at: **Encryption/x64/Release/test.txt.pdea**.  
I have named my algorithm PDEA (Pyros Data Encryption Algorithm).  
- The Block size for my algorithm is 576 bits.  
- The Key size for my algorithm is 512 bits.  
Have Fun ðŸ˜€.
